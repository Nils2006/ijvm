This is my implementation of Tanenbaums ijvm. It uses a limited instruction set introduced in the book Structured Computer Organization (6th Edition) by Andrew S. Tanenbaum and Todd Austin. This version does not support WIDE. INVOKEVITRUAL and IRETURN are not implemented yet. The program takes a .ijvm file as its first parameter and prints the stack at the end. A .ijvm file is built by tool you can find here https://github.com/Nils2006/ijvm-compiler or by writing bits to a file. The file starts with a byte that indicates the length of the Variables for the constant pool. After that all variables of the constant pool follow. After those variables the instructions need to be added.
